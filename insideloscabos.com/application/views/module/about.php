          <p class="section-subcontent text-left">The dining scene in Los Cabos is very varied, from the high end class resturants to the less fancy but also great restaurants of both cities. The area with the best restaurants is San Jose del Cabo. Cabo San Lucas has more restaurants but they are generally more popular, more commercial. For those who love fine dining there are not so many options in Cabo San Lucas -- not as many as in San Jose. </p>
